  Lets see how pair programming fits in the data science world.
title: Pairing for Data Scientists
---

He ya! Happy 2016!! I am two months old now at Pivotal Labs Data Science Team at London and the journey so far has been nothing but exciting. I have been introduced to new working methodologies to make data science (DS) agile. For those thinking that there goes another vague buzzword...

To me, data science is essentially getting to know your own venture; knowing it better by delving deeper into all the information you have or can have, discovering its nitty-gritty and using this valuable piece to influence your future affluently. Others might be a bit inquisitive about how Data Science and agile is being used together. I was too when I first interacted with the DS EMEA team in London.

## Data Science the _Agile_ way
Data Science can be fairly broad and exploratory. In such an environment, an agile way can help to iterate and speed up process and help us to not get lost in the vast problem search space. The DS team at Pivotal recently became a part of Pivotal Labs and we have been trying to adopt the Labs culture and techniques from which data science could benefit.

We are integrating classic labs techniques like having daily stand-ups, regular retro, pivotal tracker, pair programming, continuous integration and test-driven development in our day-to-day work. I won’t say everything has fallen into place yet; we are still exploring how (or to what level) these techniques fit the data science world. This time, I’ll discuss my experience with Pair Programming in data science so far.

## Pair Programming

Hmmmm… Pair Programming is exactly what it sounds. If you ever get a chance to visit the Labs office you will see two developers sharing a big desk space and working on two mirrored screens simultaneously. Sounds interesting and a bit challenging…. Honestly when I first saw this alien style of programming I had concerns about how productive it could be in a DS environment. Yes we have to code as data scientist! For those who didn’t know, DS involves programming right from the initial feature creation and exploratory phase to model development and its operationalization.

### Few Handy Tips
* Pairing is energy intensive and will be exhausting. Take frequent breaks.
* Screenhero is quite effective for working on a collaborative screen sharing experience remotely.
* Have a brainstorming session at the start. Discuss various techniques that can be applied, be innovative then narrow the choices down and start implementing it.
* Be kind, receptive and open to other ideas.
* Think aloud.
* While pairing remotely, make sure you have a seamless Internet connection. Trust me it pairing can get fairly frustrating otherwise.
* If you are new to a certain language, brush it up before hand. In case both you and your pair is in doubt, Google comes to rescue :)

### Hoops to Jump through
When you start on a DS use case your objective is fairly broad. You need to spend a lot of time to find the right way to materialize the objective. You have to flare and focus repeatedly between coming up with a more definite objective and shipping it as an end product.

I had my doubts about how pairing would fit this flare and focus process. It’s not equivalent to pairing in a software engineering environment where the goals are more definitive and the pair can work together in introducing a new feature to an interface. During DS flaring, one might come with a number of problems and consequently an even larger number of ways to tackle them; having another person in the entire development process might make this phase intense and long because different people can have different ways to approach a problem.

For DS, there is no best tool for the task at hand. If one DS is comfortable using python that might not necessarily be the same for his/her pair. Although, this is a great opportunity to expand one’s skill set but it might be a little disconcerting to run to Google for some basic syntax check with your pair watching over you!

In general another hoop a pair might come across is when the two individuals pairing have different levels of expertise. I didn’t know how daunting an experience it would be for a newbie to code in this environment or how frustrating could it be for the experienced one to trying to get the noobie up to speed.

### Day 3 _@Pivotal_ and henceforth..
I started pairing with Ian, a Senior DS in my team and started jumping through these hoops. He helped me get comfortable with the process in my first few weeks. In the exploratory phase, it actually turned out that more the number of heads brainstorming about a problem, the faster it is to come up with a variety of routes and then narrowing it down to the most preferred one.

After an initial brainstorming, we came up with certain set of features we thought would be predictive for the problem case in hand and started to develop it. We followed a test-driven feature generation process. In a ping-pong manner, one would come up with a test case first and then the other would write up the functionality to implement it and then the role would reverse for the next round.

My initial concerns about working with people of varied level of experience eased out. Having an experienced person as your pair helps you understand the pros and cons of various approaches better, so you save a lot of time by choosing better.

We follow extreme programming practices in Pivotal. Ian was kind and encouraged me to be inquisitive and welcomed a newbie’s ideas. I really enjoyed my initial pairing experience and started getting used to it. Since then, I have paired with other colleagues and clients and I really enjoy pairing.

It’s a great enablement technique. While pairing with clients, it makes them feel more involved and by developing a use case together they understand the code base better than a regular handover session at the end of project cycle. In the process, you understand the business requirements better. Pairing with a colleague makes exploration and development much more fun. Pairing helps in exchanging knowledge and skills.

“Pairing is sharing” as one of my colleagues always tell me :). It is a concentrated cohesive effort that helps in fast iterative development. It’s a good way to enable each other and develop something in synergy.

_Pairing is a great bonding exercise, would recommend giving it a shot!_
